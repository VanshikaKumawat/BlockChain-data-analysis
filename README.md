# Blockchain Forensics: Detecting Anomalous Ethereum Wallet Behavior

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent behavior in Ethereum wallets using machine learning techniques. By extracting structured, wallet-centric features from Ethereum transaction data, we aim to classify wallets as either **normal** or **suspicious**, helping improve security and transparency in blockchain ecosystems.

The system leverages real transaction data and builds ensemble models capable of identifying patterns indicative of scam or anomalous activity. This project lies at the intersection of **blockchain forensics** and **AI-powered fraud detection**, offering value to both academic research and industrial applications.

## üéØ Objectives

- Understand and explore Ethereum's blockchain data structure, focusing on transaction and wallet-level behavior.
- Aggregate and clean wallet data from verified public sources such as Etherscan or Kaggle.
- Engineer features such as transaction frequency, wallet age, average value, etc.
- Train supervised ML models like Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and TabNet to detect fraudulent patterns.
- Evaluate model performance and highlight important behavioral indicators.
- Deliver an interactive dashboard and visual summaries to interpret results effectively.
